# Face-Classification
Based on David Sandberg's Face recognition project for FaceNet. Classifies faces from training images. To add test with more faces, add copies of the face to the training data set in data/images and then add another copy/version to th test data set.

To demo, first run 
```
pip install requirements.txt
```

Then modify the demo.sh file to the appropriate paths based on where your project is located.

Then run the bash script :)
